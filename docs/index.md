# InterVar

InterVar is a bioinformatics software tool for clinical interpretation of genetic variants by the ACMG2015 guideline. The input to InterVar is an annotated file generated from ANNOVAR, while the output of InterVar is the classification of variants into 'benign', 'likely benign', 'VUS', 'likely pathogenic' and 'pathogenic', together with detailed evidence code.
